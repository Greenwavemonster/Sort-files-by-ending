# Sort-files-by-ending
Files are sorted by file extension

## The Magic
If the probably longest switch/case you will see today, which scans the files by their extensions and then sorts them accordingly to those. For .jpg it creates a folder named jpg and moves (not copy!) all .jpg files there. The desired endings must be set in the script.

It will open and scan all folders within the directory you feed the script at the beginning. The directory itself will not be scanned. 

150GB of data tool me around 5 min to sort (with the script above)

Have fun, G
